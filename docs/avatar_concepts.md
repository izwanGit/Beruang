# Gamified Avatar Progression: The Wise Bear's Journey

To implement the gamification element, we will create a series of 13 avatars that track the user's "evolution" from a beginner saver to a financial master. Each level is represented by a "Beruang" (Bear) in a different stage of life or occupation.

### Base Character Template (The "Chill Bear" standard)
To ensure all 13 bears look like a consistent set, use this base description for every generation:
> **Base**: A soft, hand-drawn kawaii mascot design of a "Beruang" (bear) in the style of minimalist capybara doodles. Very simple "blob" body shape, clean brown hand-drawn outlines, and flat pastel colors. The bear has tiny simple black bead eyes, a small rounded snout, and a very calm, "chill" expression. Full upper body and face framing. Facing 3/4 to the right. White background, cozy and minimalist aesthetic. High-end Sanrio-style character design.
